    Hi! Welcome to a day in my life! Y'all ever seen those study vlogs? Yea this is gonna be like that. Let me show you what I've been up to!
  </p>
  <h4 class = "time">
    0545: Wake Up
  </h4>
  <p>
    You're probably wondering who in the right mind wakes up at 5.30 in the morning? Well, I've got a busy day today and we've got to get an early start!
  <h4 class="time">
    0615: MRT ride/Quiet time
  </h4>
  <p>
    Pasir Ris is a pretty good place to stay, apart from the fact that it's far away from everything. But I'm used to it, and I try to make the most out of it by reading on the train. Just make sure you don't miss your stop!
  </p>
  <h4 class= "time">
    0710: Hello Kallang!
  </h4>

    Good Morning Singapore!
  </h6>
  <p>
    We're headed to Kallang Sea Training Centre for kayaking today! There's a lot of prep that needs to be done since I'm an instructor so I'll catch y'all later when I'm in the water. Cya!
  </p>
  <h4 class= "time">
    0815: Kayak crew, you are cleared for lanch off
  </h4>
  <p>
    Alright we are good to go! My role today is to assess other kayakers from secondary schools to see if they meet the grade for the mini kayaking expedition. It's pretty good weather today, hopefully there isn't a cat 1 and I don't have to shout at cadets. See y'all back on land!
